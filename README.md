# [shroomid.net](https://shroomid.net)
Spring 2020 CPSC 462  
The goal of shroomid.net is to id poison mushrooms from user photos.
Species identification is needed to id a posion mushroom and currently
can only do genus identification.

## Project
The project is a server free application using AWS,TensorFlow and Inception v3. models to make
predictions on images.

## Dataset
For this project we are using the [dataset](https://github.com/visipedia/fgvcx_fungi_comp#data) from the Natural History Museum of Denmark: Fungi Classification Challenge.  

> The dataset holds 1,394 wild mushrooms species, with 85,578 training images and
> 4,182 validation images. The testing set contains 9,758 images.
